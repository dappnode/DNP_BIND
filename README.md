# Dappnode Bind Core Package

üåê This package acts as the DNS proxy for the Dappnode Packages. When connected to DAppNode, all DNS requests from your device are first sent to this package. It resolves DAppNode-specific domains locally and forwards all other DNS queries to the configured upstream DNSCrypt resolvers, ensuring secure and private name resolution for both DAppNode services and general internet browsing.

## Environment Variables

### PUBLIC_RESOLVERS_OVERRIDE

The `PUBLIC_RESOLVERS_OVERRIDE` environment variable allows you to customize the DNSCrypt resolvers used by the package. By default, the package uses a curated list of reliable public resolvers:
- scaleway-fr
- commons-host
- dnscrypt.me
- cloudflare

You can override these defaults by providing a comma-separated list of resolver names. For example:
```
PUBLIC_RESOLVERS_OVERRIDE=quad9,adguard-dns,google
```

#### DNSCrypt Features

The DNS proxy in this package uses DNSCrypt-proxy with the following security features enabled:

- **DNSCrypt and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)**: Supports both DNSCrypt and DoH protocols for encrypted DNS queries
- **No-logging Policy**: Only uses resolvers that pledge not to log user queries
- **No-filter Policy**: Uses resolvers that don't enforce their own blocklists
- **IPv4 Support**: Compatible with IPv4 networks
- **TCP/UDP Support**: Uses UDP by default for better performance, with TCP fallback available

The proxy is configured to handle up to 250 simultaneous client connections and listens on all interfaces (0.0.0.0:53).
